# Courier
---
Courier aims to be a light-weight library based on Valve's [GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets).
## Building
Currently, we're statically linking GameNetworkingSockets. However, the following are required by GNS:  
- openssl >= 1.1.1
- protobuf >= 2.6.1
